# Screenshot Logger

This is a type of python malware that take screenshots on your target machine and send them to your server you controll.<br />
It's inspired by Keylogger :)
It only works for Windows.

### Disclaimer

### How to run

```
python3 listener.py
```

### Before you try

Obviously, you run listener.py on your server and run logger.py on your target machine. However, tricking your target person to run logger.py is not realistic, right? So you basically have to compile logger.py to windows executable by using tools such as Pyinstaller.<br />
Hmmm, It's still not perfect. There is no such things as perfect malware though. How can you improve this malware? Maybe you can make it persistent, let it run in background or make it look like a PDF file.<br />
You are only limited by your imagination. Good luck!
